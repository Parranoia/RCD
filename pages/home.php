                    <h3>Results of our Needs Assessment</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to evaluate the need for a quality child care in Radford, we conducted a <a target="_blank" href="docs/NeedsAssessment.pdf">needs assessment</a> with members of the Radford community this year. We sought to measure the discrepancy between the current condition and the desired condition. We determined and documented a critical need in quality child care in Radford. Based on our research, 9 out of 10 children in Radford do not have access to a state-licensed child care.
